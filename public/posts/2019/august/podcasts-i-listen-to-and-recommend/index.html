                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to podcasts for a couple years. Most of the time when listening to a podcast I will be driving a virtual truck making virtual deliveries either in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> or, more recently, in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/270880/American_Truck_Simulator/">American Truck Simulator</a>. Over the course of roughly about the past year I started listening to my podcasts at 1.5x speed so that it takes less time to listen to the episodes. It sounds a little funny at first, but you get use to it surprisingly quick. My podcast app of choice is <a href="https://www.pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a>, which is multi-platform and available on Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and they even have a <a href="https://play.pocketcasts.com/">Web Player</a>. And it syncs your listening progress across all your devices! Alright, lets dive in and talk about some of the podcasts that I listen to:</p>
<h2 id="_hello-internet_"><em>Hello Internet</em></h2>
<p><a href="https:/hellointernet.fm">Hello Internet</a> is probably the first podcast I ever listened to. The hosts are <a href="https://www.cgpgrey.com/">CGP Grey</a> and <a href="http://www.bradyharan.com/">&ldquo;Dr.&rdquo; Brady Haran</a>. They talk about random stuff. Most of the time they talk about YouTube, plane crashes, NASA and various other science-y things, and it&rsquo;s overall just a really entertaining podcast to listen to. Highly recommend.</p>
<h2 id="_cortex_"><em>Cortex</em></h2>
<p><a href="https://relay.fm/cortex">Cortex</a> is a podcast hosted by CGP Grey and <a href="https://www.relay.fm/people/mykehurley">Myke Hurley</a> (co-founder of Relay FM), where they both discuss their working lives as independent content creators. It&rsquo;s a more niche podcast to listen to, but I thoroughly enjoy it. Frequent topics of discussion include: Apple products (which is unrelatable to me since I am an Android user), occasionally video games &ndash; particularly American Truck Simulator, Email, Time tracking, and To-do list apps.</p>
<h2 id="_the-pornhub-podcast_"><em>The Pornhub Podcast</em></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/asa-akira/the-pornhub-podcast-with-asa-akira">The Pornhub Podcast</a> is hosted by Asa Akira and she has a guest each episode. They discuss all things pop culture, sex, and feelings. As a sex-positive individual I find this podcast interesting and entertaining. It also gives unique insight into the porn and sex industry world.</p>
<h2 id="_serial_-and-_s-town_"><em>Serial</em> and <em>S-Town</em></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a> and <a href="https://stownpodcast.org/">S-Town</a> podcasts are both produced by the same team. I thoroughly enjoyed S-Town and all three (I think) seasons of Serial. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, Season One of Serial was around the time that I first started listening to podcasts. It&rsquo;s been a while, so I don&rsquo;t really remember anything about these podcasts. I do remember that I enjoyed them and that they are definitely a good recommendation if you are looking for something to listen to.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: July 6, 2020</strong></p>
<h2 id="_the-prevention-podcast_-and-_sex-human-rights-and-csa-prevention_"><em>The Prevention Podcast</em> and <em>Sex, Human Rights, and CSA Prevention</em></h2>
<p>Thes two podcasts, <em><a href="http://thepreventionpodcast.com/">The Prevention Podcast</a></em> and _<a href="https://prostasia.org/sex-human-rights-csa-prevention-podcast/">Sex, Human Rights, and CSA Prevention</a> are really good podcasts for anyone that is interested in sex, human rights, and child sex abuse preventijon. The first podcast is run by <a href="http://theglobalpreventionproject.org/">The Global Prevention Project</a> and the second podcast is run by <a href="https://prostasia.org/">Prostasia Foundation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="_youre-wrong-about_"><em>You&rsquo;re Wrong About</em></h2>
<p>The <em><a href="https://yourewrongabout.com/">You&rsquo;re Wrong About</a></em> podcast covers various topics that you&rsquo;ve probably heard about but either what you know is wrong or you only know part of the story. It&rsquo;s really entertaining and educational.</p>
