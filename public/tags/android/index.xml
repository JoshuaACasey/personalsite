      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the year. I would like to take some time to review some of the apps that I have installed on my phone that I consider worth recommending. I will maybe separate this into separate categories: productivity, messaging, social, financial, and possibly &amp;ldquo;honorary mentions&amp;rdquo;.
Productivity   Todoist
This is probably my favorite to-do list app. And they recently added a dark mode which I greatly appreciate as a necessary accessibility feature.</description>
