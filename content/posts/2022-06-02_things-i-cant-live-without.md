# 1. My Best Friend
There is no doubt in my mind that one of the things I couldn't live without is my best friend. She is my rock. She is the kindest, loveliest person and I have never felt as close to another person as I do to her. I know that I can always count on her and she can always count on me. We will always be there for each other. I got extremely lucky to meet and have such a caring person in my life.  

# 2. Dogs (or pets)  
As I've mentioned before, I am autistic. I believe my life improved after we got our first dog. When she's in the same room as me I feel more comfortable. And if someone else is in the room talking to me, I can focus my attention and look at or pet the dogs, which makes me feel pretty much 110% more comfortable. I don't think I want to ever try to live without a dog (or some other little furry pet) in my life ever again. Plus, dogs are one of the only living creatures that will love you unconditionally.  

# 3. My smartphone  
I don't know how I lived before we had smartphones. Being able to pay at the store with my phone is such a timesaver -- much quicker than paying with cash or using a card. Having my access to my calendar or my ([to-do](https://todoist.com/r/joshua_mvcbsg) list  at all times is also a convenience that I don't think I would be able to give up. Not to mention some of the other conveniences -- ordering food, checking email or messages, checking the weather, or using Google Translate if you're in a situation involving a non-English language.  

# 4. The Internet  
Last but not least, the Internet. I could never survive without it. For the second time this post I'm going to mention being autistic. It is incredibly difficult and uncomfortable to talk to people face-to-face. With the Internet I can talk to people through a computer screen, either by typing on a keyboard or video chat. Using text to communicate is my preferred method of communication. Without the Internet, I don't think this would be possible, and I've thought many times how grateful I am that I was born during the time that I was and not decades earlier.  

There you have it, a list, albeit short and probably incomplete of all the things that I cannot imagine life without. I obviously excluded the necessities like food, water, and medicine. I'm fairly certain those don't need to be mentioned.
