I'm a big fan of lists, checklists, and to-do lists. It's only natural that the idea of a "bucket list" is something that I am a fan of. Here is mine (I will probably update it frequently so feel free to check back from time to time):  

- [ ] First IRL/non-Internet friend.  
- [ ] First kiss.  
- [ ] First relationship.  
- [ ] Own a Tesla.  
- [ ] Visit all 48 of the Continental United States. (maybe on a road trip?)  
- [ ] Visit Canada (at least Ontario)  
- [ ] Learn how to fly & get my PPL.    
- [ ] Get in better shape (I'd like to have a sit/stand desk. Maybe start walking on a treadmill?)  
- [ ] Earn money (dream job would be working for Twitch or Pornhub -- two very awesome companies)  
- [x] Graduate High School (May 31, 2008)  
- [x] First concert (Barenaked Ladies on November, 16, 2006)
- [x] First (and only) Rush concert (April 12, 2011)
