I've been listening to podcasts for a couple years. Most of the time when listening to a podcast I will be driving a virtual truck making virtual deliveries either in [Euro Truck Simulator 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/) or, more recently, in [American Truck Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/270880/American_Truck_Simulator/). Over the course of roughly about the past year I started listening to my podcasts at 1.5x speed so that it takes less time to listen to the episodes. It sounds a little funny at first, but you get use to it surprisingly quick. My podcast app of choice is [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/), which is multi-platform and available on Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and they even have a [Web Player](https://play.pocketcasts.com/). And it syncs your listening progress across all your devices! Alright, lets dive in and talk about some of the podcasts that I listen to:  

## _Hello Internet_  
[Hello Internet](https:/hellointernet.fm) is probably the first podcast I ever listened to. The hosts are [CGP Grey](https://www.cgpgrey.com/) and ["Dr." Brady Haran](http://www.bradyharan.com/). They talk about random stuff. Most of the time they talk about YouTube, plane crashes, NASA and various other science-y things, and it's overall just a really entertaining podcast to listen to. Highly recommend.  

## _Cortex_  
[Cortex](https://relay.fm/cortex) is a podcast hosted by CGP Grey and [Myke Hurley](https://www.relay.fm/people/mykehurley) (co-founder of Relay FM), where they both discuss their working lives as independent content creators. It's a more niche podcast to listen to, but I thoroughly enjoy it. Frequent topics of discussion include: Apple products (which is unrelatable to me since I am an Android user), occasionally video games -- particularly American Truck Simulator, Email, Time tracking, and To-do list apps.  

## _The Pornhub Podcast_  
[The Pornhub Podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/asa-akira/the-pornhub-podcast-with-asa-akira) is hosted by Asa Akira and she has a guest each episode. They discuss all things pop culture, sex, and feelings. As a sex-positive individual I find this podcast interesting and entertaining. It also gives unique insight into the porn and sex industry world.  

## _Serial_ and _S-Town_  
The [Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/) and [S-Town](https://stownpodcast.org/) podcasts are both produced by the same team. I thoroughly enjoyed S-Town and all three (I think) seasons of Serial. If I'm not mistaken, Season One of Serial was around the time that I first started listening to podcasts. It's been a while, so I don't really remember anything about these podcasts. I do remember that I enjoyed them and that they are definitely a good recommendation if you are looking for something to listen to.

## _The Prevention Podcast_ and _Sex, Human Rights, and CSA Prevention_
Thes two podcasts, _[The Prevention Podcast](http://thepreventionpodcast.com/)_ and _[Sex, Human Rights, and CSA Prevention](https://prostasia.org/sex-human-rights-csa-prevention-podcast/) are really good podcasts for anyone that is interested in sex, human rights, and child sex abuse preventijon. The first podcast is run by [The Global Prevention Project](http://theglobalpreventionproject.org/) and the second podcast is run by [Prostasia Foundation](https://prostasia.org/).

## _You're Wrong About_
The _[You're Wrong About](https://yourewrongabout.com/)_ podcast covers various topics that you've probably heard about but either what you know is wrong or you only know part of the story. It's really entertaining and educational.
