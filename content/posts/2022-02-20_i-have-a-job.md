I have some exciting news to share. Unfortunately, because of procrastination, this news is two months old. I have a job. Sort of. I'll explain that part later. As an autistic person, I have always enjoyed using social media (specifically twitter) as a way to advocate for causes that I am passionate about, due to social media making it easier to be social. Three years ago, in 2019, I added the prevention of child sexual abuse to the long list of causes that I champion and advocate for. That advocacy led me to the child protection organization, [Prostasia Foundation](https://prostasia.org/about/). Prostasia is a different kind of child protection organization that pushes for an evidence-based approach to preventing child sexual abuse by listening to scientists and treating abuse as the public health issue that it is.  

As a very pro-science person myself -- I'm an avid supporter [Greta Thunberg](https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg)'s message of "[Listen to the Scientists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h0tB0RrqQA)" -- which is why it was somewhat of a relief when I discovered Prostasia, and their pro-science stance. We cannot successfully prevent sexual abuse unless we listen to the scientists whose job it is to do research to learn (and tell the rest of us their findings) about:  

1. **Who** commits abuse?  
2. **Why** and **how** does abuse occur?  
3. What **is** effective at preventing abuse?  
4. What **is not** effective at preventing abuse?  

I joined Prostasia's team as Social Media Manager in December 2021. I am thrilled to be part of this organization and to help do my part to make the world a better and safer place. After doing independent advocacy for preventing child abuse for the previous 3 years, it felt like my advocacy efforts had been noticed when Prostasia's now former Program Director reached out and asked if I would be willing to help out. Let's get back to that "job" part. While, yes, it is a job. I am not paid, so *technically* I am a volunteer. I am thrilled to be a volunteer though. Yes, as an unemployed autistic person it would certainly be wonderful to be paid. But I am so passionate about the wonderful cause of preventing child abuse (just as I am passionate about all the other causes that I support, like human rights and free speech), that I am completely happy to do this work as a volunteer. I'm really just honored and consider myself very lucky to be given this opportunity to help out!  

# Blog Update  

I know that it has been a long time since my last blog post. I have always been really bad at blogging. I'm not a very good writer. I can *sort of* write fiction -- and even then I am pretty bad at it! Writing stuff that is not fiction is significantly more challenging. I would like to try to blog more, but don't count on it. I actually would like to re-write some previous blog posts so that hopefully they are better written.
