I've spent way too much time trying to think about what my dream job would be. When you're autistic like I am it's a daily struggle to live in a world that is not built for people like you and a world that is constantly fighting against you. Personally, I know that because of some of the difficulties that I have from being autistic, I could never have a "traditional" job. I certainly could never have a job that requires face-to-face or phone interactions with customers. I could never have a job that requires much physical activity or heavy lifting.  

My ideal "dream" job is a job that lets me work from home using my own computer. With a flexible schedule--this is important because I do quite like being awake at night sometimes. Night time is very peaceful and quiet. It's a very lovely experience that I enjoy. A job that lets me communicate with co-workers or customers using email or instant message instead of phone or face-to-face interactions would also be absolutely necessary. I, unfortunately, am very fearful that this kind of job doesn't exist (which is probably why it is estimated that [more than 80% of Autistic adults](https://blog.easterseals.com/unemployment-rates-for-adults-with-autism/) around the world are unemployed). Although, I am trying to be optimistic that perhaps there is one out there. If I could pick any company that I would love to work for, I think I would pick [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jobs/#opportunities) or [Pornhub](https://www.pornhub.com/jobs/).
