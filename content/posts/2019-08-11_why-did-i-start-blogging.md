Over the years of my life I have tried many times to start blogging and do it on a frequent basis. All previous attempts have never really been a success. There are a couple of reasons why I decided to start writing blog posts on this website. The first reason is that I host this website myself (for free). I don't have to rely on Wordpress or Tumblr or any other blogging platform.  

The other reason why I decided to start blogging is because I want to try to write more. I use to enjoy and do a lot of writing when I was younger. I enjoyed English class. I spent a lot of time involved in a Star Wars roleplay forum, writing fairly lengthy posts. I even wrote a couple fictional stories that, unfortunately, I have never published to the Internet because I feel like they are not good enough. Sadly, I will probably never write and publish any fictional work because I do not believe I'm a good enough writer to publicize my fictional works. I barely think my non-fictional writing is good enough to publish, but writing a blog is a good way to get my thoughts and beliefs out of my head and onto a metaphorical piece of paper. Therefore, I chose to make a New Year's Resolution this year to start blogging in an attempt to start writing more.  

As you can see from the date of this blog post and the date of my last blog post ([)2019-04-25), I am not necessarily blogging as frequently as I would have liked to. I have a list of potential blog post ideas that I got from the Internet (thank you Internet!), but I am a bit of a procrastinator. I was actually tempted to procrastinate this post in favor of organizing my password manager (it is an unorganized mess) or playing video games. Hopefully I will be more active on here and writing posts more frequently -- we'll see!
