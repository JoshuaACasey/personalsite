I'm an autistic adult that enjoys video games and passionate about advocating for human rights, free speech, privacy, anti-censorship, autistic people's rights, sex worker's rights, climate change, criminal legal system reform, and child sexual abuse prevention. In December 2021, I became a Social Media Manager for Prostasia Foundation, a child protection and human rights organization.

# My Bucket List  

- [ ] Obtaining financial independence thru content creation (probably using my enjoyment of video games to [stream on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/JoshuaACasey)).  
- [ ] Meet my best friend in person & hang out with her.  
- [ ] An electric vehicle (preferably a Tesla or Cybertruck)
