I'm an autistic adult that enjoys video games and passionate about advocating for human rights, free speech, privacy, anti-censorship, autistic people's rights, sex worker's rights, climate change, criminal legal system reform, and child sexual abuse prevention. In December 2021, I became a Social Media Manager for [Prostasia Foundation](https://prostasia.org/about/), a child protection and human rights organization.
